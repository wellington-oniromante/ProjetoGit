DEFENSIVE DISPERSAL**


> Nanocyte

By using a nanite surge as a reaction when you take damage, you can protect yourself with your nanites when they create a temporary barrier or cause part of your body to temporarily disperse. You reduce the damage dealt by the triggering effect by an amount equal to your nanocyte level plus your Constitution modifier, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the first saving throw against the effect (such as the initial saving throw to resist a poison, but not subsequent saves against it).
