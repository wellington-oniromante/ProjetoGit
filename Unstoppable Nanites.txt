Unstoppable Nanites (Ex)
> Obliteration

Weapons you form with your gear array gain the penetrating and boost 1d4 special properties. To use the boost property with a weapon that doesnâ€™t have charges, you must use one nanite surge instead of expending additional charges. At 5th level, the boost special property increases to 1d6, and it increases by an additional 1d6 at 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
