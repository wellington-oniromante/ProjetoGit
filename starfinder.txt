ROBOTICIST

You are  Fascinated by the internal workings of machines, whether they're intelligent constructs or technological equipment. You might be someone who enjoys tinkering in a garage, or you might be a worker at a factory that specializes in building robots or weaponry. You're likely interested in exploring and figuring out the innovations of other organizations and species on distant worlds. Regardless of your specific motivation, there's always a gadget that needs tinkering with.

 

THEME KNOWLEDGE (1ST)
You're obsessed with the intricacies of constructs and how automated machines function. You can easily identify what a machine's function is and have an easier time attempting to access the internal programming of mechanized life-forms. Reduce the DC of Engineering checks to identify creatures and technology by 5. Computers is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from a class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Computers checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Intelligence at character creation.


FASCINATED**
 Conditions

You are entranced.

While you have the fascinated condition, you stand or sit quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts.

You take a –4 penalty to skill checks made passively in response to others’ actions, such as Perception checks.

Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, grants you a new saving throw against the fascinating effect.

Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at you, automatically ends the condition.

An ally can shake you free of the effect and end this condition as a standard action
